/* The ziplist is a specially encoded dually linked list that is designed
 * to be very memory efficient. It stores both strings and integer values,
 * where integers are encoded as actual integers instead of a series of
 * characters. It allows push and pop operations on either side of the list
 * in O(1) time. However, because every operation requires a reallocation of
 * the memory used by the ziplist, the actual complexity is related to the
 * amount of memory used by the ziplist.
 *

 *
 * ZIPLIST OVERALL LAYOUT
 * ======================
 *
 * The general layout of the ziplist is as follows:
 * 一般的ziplist结构如下：
 *
 * <zlbytes> <zltail> <zllen> <entry> <entry> ... <entry> <zlend>
 *
 * NOTE: all fields are stored in little endian, if not specified otherwise.
 *
 * <uint32_t zlbytes> is an unsigned integer to hold the number of bytes that
 * the ziplist occupies, including the four bytes of the zlbytes field itself.
 * This value needs to be stored to be able to resize the entire structure
 * without the need to traverse it first.
 * <uint32_t zlbytes> ziplist占用的总字节数
 *
 * <uint32_t zltail> is the offset to the last entry in the list. This allows
 * a pop operation on the far side of the list without the need for full
 * traversal.
 * <uint32_t zltail> 到列表中最后一个entry的偏移量。
 * 通过该值可以迅速定位到最后一个entry，以便做类似反向遍历等操作。
 *
 * <uint16_t zllen> is the number of entries. When there are more than
 * 2^16-2 entries, this value is set to 2^16-1 and we need to traverse the
 * entire list to know how many items it holds.
 * 列表中entry总个数，对于超2^16-2的数值，全部使用用2^16-1表示，这时程序需要遍历超过
 * 部分的entry，才能知道列表的实际大小。
 *
 * <uint8_t zlend> is a special entry representing the end of the ziplist.
 * Is encoded as a single byte equal to 255. No other normal entry starts
 * with a byte set to the value of 255.
 * 表示ziplist结尾的特殊字符
 *
 * ZIPLIST ENTRIES
 * ===============
 *
 * Every entry in the ziplist is prefixed by metadata that contains two pieces
 * of information. First, the length of the previous entry is stored to be
 * able to traverse the list from back to front. Second, the entry encoding is
 * provided. It represents the entry type, integer or string, and in the case
 * of strings it also represents the length of the string payload.
 * So a complete entry is stored like this:
 * 一个完整的entry结构如下：
 *
 * <prevlen> <encoding> <entry-data>
 *
 * Sometimes the encoding represents the entry itself, like for small integers
 * as we'll see later. In such a case the <entry-data> part is missing, and we
 * could have just:
 * 有些情况下，encoding中可以包含entry-data的值，比如存放（0-12）的整型值时，
 * 这种情况下，entry-data部分将会被省去。
 * |1111xxxx|
 *
 * <prevlen> <encoding>
 *
 * The length of the previous entry, <prevlen>, is encoded in the following way:
 * If this length is smaller than 254 bytes, it will only consume a single
 * byte representing the length as an unsinged 8 bit integer. When the length
 * is greater than or equal to 254, it will consume 5 bytes. The first byte is
 * set to 254 (FE) to indicate a larger value is following. The remaining 4
 * bytes take the length of the previous entry as value.
 * prevlen表示之前entry所占空间的大小，当长度小于254时，仅会使用1个字节来保存，而当长度大于等于254时，
 * 就会使用5个字节来保存该值。
 *
 * So practically an entry is encoded in the following way:
 * 1个字节保存的情况：
 *
 * <prevlen from 0 to 253> <encoding> <entry>
 *
 * Or alternatively if the previous entry length is greater than 253 bytes
 * the following encoding is used:
 * 5个字节保存的情况：
 *
 * 0xFE <4 bytes unsigned little endian prevlen> <encoding> <entry>
 *
 * The encoding field of the entry depends on the content of the
 * entry. When the entry is a string, the first 2 bits of the encoding first
 * byte will hold the type of encoding used to store the length of the string,
 * followed by the actual length of the string. When the entry is an integer
 * the first 2 bits are both set to 1. The following 2 bits are used to specify
 * what kind of integer will be stored after this header. An overview of the
 * different types and encodings is as follows. The first byte is always enough
 * to determine the kind of entry.
 * 这里的编码方式的主要作用就是保存之后具体数据所占用的空间大小，为了节约存储空间和程序使用的便利，
 * 设计定义了如下多种类型。
 *
 * |00pppppp| - 1 byte
 *      String value with length less than or equal to 63 bytes (6 bits).
 *      "pppppp" represents the unsigned 6 bit length.
 * |01pppppp|qqqqqqqq| - 2 bytes
 *      String value with length less than or equal to 16383 bytes (14 bits).
 *      IMPORTANT: The 14 bit number is stored in big endian.
 * |10000000|qqqqqqqq|rrrrrrrr|ssssssss|tttttttt| - 5 bytes
 *      String value with length greater than or equal to 16384 bytes.
 *      Only the 4 bytes following the first byte represents the length
 *      up to 32^2-1. The 6 lower bits of the first byte are not used and
 *      are set to zero.
 *      IMPORTANT: The 32 bit number is stored in big endian.
 * |11000000| - 3 bytes
 *      Integer encoded as int16_t (2 bytes).
 * |11010000| - 5 bytes
 *      Integer encoded as int32_t (4 bytes).
 * |11100000| - 9 bytes
 *      Integer encoded as int64_t (8 bytes).
 * |11110000| - 4 bytes
 *      Integer encoded as 24 bit signed (3 bytes).
 * |11111110| - 2 bytes
 *      Integer encoded as 8 bit signed (1 byte).
 * |1111xxxx| - (with xxxx between 0000 and 1101) immediate 4 bit integer.
 *      Unsigned integer from 0 to 12. The encoded value is actually from
 *      1 to 13 because 0000 and 1111 can not be used, so 1 should be
 *      subtracted from the encoded 4 bit value to obtain the right value.
 * |11111111| - End of ziplist special entry.
 *
 * Like for the ziplist header, all the integers are represented in little
 * endian byte order, even when this code is compiled in big endian systems.
 *
 * EXAMPLES OF ACTUAL ZIPLISTS
 * ===========================
 *
 * The following is a ziplist containing the two elements representing
 * the strings "2" and "5". It is composed of 15 bytes, that we visually
 * split into sections:
 *
 *  [0f 00 00 00] [0c 00 00 00] [02 00] [00 f3] [02 f6] [ff]
 *        |             |          |       |       |     |
 *     zlbytes        zltail    entries   "2"     "5"   end
 *
 * The first 4 bytes represent the number 15, that is the number of bytes
 * the whole ziplist is composed of. The second 4 bytes are the offset
 * at which the last ziplist entry is found, that is 12, in fact the
 * last entry, that is "5", is at offset 12 inside the ziplist.
 * The next 16 bit integer represents the number of elements inside the
 * ziplist, its value is 2 since there are just two elements inside.
 * Finally "00 f3" is the first entry representing the number 2. It is
 * composed of the previous entry length, which is zero because this is
 * our first entry, and the byte F3 which corresponds to the encoding
 * |1111xxxx| with xxxx between 0001 and 1101. We need to remove the "F"
 * higher order bits 1111, and subtract 1 from the "3", so the entry value
 * is "2". The next entry has a prevlen of 02, since the first entry is
 * composed of exactly two bytes. The entry itself, F6, is encoded exactly
 * like the first entry, and 6-1 = 5, so the value of the entry is 5.
 * Finally the special entry FF signals the end of the ziplist.
 *
 * Adding another element to the above string with the value "Hello World"
 * allows us to show how the ziplist encodes small strings. We'll just show
 * the hex dump of the entry itself. Imagine the bytes as following the
 * entry that stores "5" in the ziplist above:
 *
 * [02] [0b] [48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 57 6f 72 6c 64]
 *
 * The first byte, 02, is the length of the previous entry. The next
 * byte represents the encoding in the pattern |00pppppp| that means
 * that the entry is a string of length <pppppp>, so 0B means that
 * an 11 bytes string follows. From the third byte (48) to the last (64)
 * there are just the ASCII characters for "Hello World".
